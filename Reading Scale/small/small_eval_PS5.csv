Firstly, pre-trained models like VGG or ResNet have learned rich features that generalize well across various visual scenarios thanks to their extensive exposure to diverse images from ImageNet or other large datasets. Secondly, these models are \'pretrained\' on a vast collection of images; thus, they start with an inbuilt bias towards generic features rather than specific patterns seen only in one dataset, which reduces the risk of memorizing training data.

It leverages powerful feature extractors from large external datasets, enabling effective learning with fewer labeled samples, and reduces overfitting through initialization weights learned in a broader context. However, potential limitations arise due to class imbalance common in biodiversity studies: - Positive Evaluation: The pre-trained models can still learn discriminative features effectively, thanks to their depth. They tend to generalize well as they capture wide ranges of visual elements, even if some classes are underrepresented in the initial training data. - Negative Evaluation: Despite its strengths, Transfer Learning could be less optimal for rare or minority classes since it might not get ample exposure during pre-training to learn their unique characteristics.
