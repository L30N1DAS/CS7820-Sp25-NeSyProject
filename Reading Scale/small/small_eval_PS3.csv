Example: How would you apply Natural Language Processing Tasks and Transformer Architectures Used for the Tasks in a real-world scenario?\n4. Example: Analyze the components and working of Natural Language Processing Tasks and Transformer Architectures Used for the Tasks.\n5.

Which model would you recommend for translating between English and Marathi, and justify your choice based on factors like data availability, computational cost, and expected translation quality.\nRationale: This tests the student‚Äôs ability to make a reasoned judgment, weighing different criteria. The inclusion of ""low-resource language"" is highly relevant to the Indian context, where many Indian languages have limited training data.', 17.5, 7.56)"
