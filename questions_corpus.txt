Taxonomy Level: Remember (1) | What is the Bag of Words (BoW) model, and how does it represent text data?  Answer: The Bag of Words model represents text by counting the frequency of each word within a document. It disregards grammar and word order but focuses on the occurrence of words.
Taxonomy Level: Understand (2) | Explain the main difference between the Bag of Words approach and word embeddings in terms of how they represent text data?  Answer: The BoW approach represents text as a sparse vector where each element corresponds to a word's frequency, ignoring context. In contrast, word embeddings capture semantic meanings by representing words in continuous vector spaces, preserving contextual relationships.
Taxonomy Level: Apply (3) | How would you apply the Bag of Words model to analyze sentiment in movie reviews from an Indian film website?  Answer: To apply the BoW model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews, first collect text data from the reviews. Convert each review into a document-term matrix using BoW, where rows represent documents (reviews) and columns represent unique words with their frequencies as values. Then, use machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes or SVM to classify these vectors into positive or negative sentiments.
Taxonomy Level: Analyze (4) | Compare the effectiveness of Bag of Words and word embeddings in understanding sentiment nuances in Hindi movie reviews?  Answer: While BoW can effectively capture frequency data, it fails to understand context or semantic similarity between words. Word embeddings, on the other hand, offer a deeper representation by capturing contextual meanings and relationships, making them more effective for discerning nuanced sentiments, especially with polysemous words common in languages like Hindi.
Taxonomy Level: Evaluate (5) | Evaluate the suitability of using word embeddings over Bag of Words for developing an AI-based chatbot that provides recommendations for regional Indian movies?

Taxonomy Level: Understand (2) | Question: Explain why LSTM networks are generally preferred over vanilla RNNs for sequence encoding tasks.  *Answer:* LSTM networks are generally preferred over vanilla RNNs because they are capable of learning long-term dependencies. The LSTM's architecture, which includes gates like the input gate, forget gate, and output gate, allows it to maintain information in memory for extended periods, thereby overcoming the vanishing gradient problem faced by RNNs, which struggle with retaining information over long sequences.
Taxonomy Level: Apply (3) | Question: You are given a dataset of customer reviews. How would you apply a neural network architecture to predict if a review is positive or negative?  *Answer:* To predict if a customer review is positive or negative, I would apply a recurrent neural network architecture such as LSTM. First, I would preprocess the text data by tokenization and padding to ensure uniform input size. Then, I would use embedding layers to convert words to vectors. The LSTM network would then process these sequences and learn patterns indicative of sentiment, followed by a dense layer with a sigmoid or softmax activation function to output probability scores for positive or negative sentiment.
Taxonomy Level: Analyze (4) | Question: Analyze the impact of using Bidirectional LSTM networks in the modeling of sequential data.  *Answer:* Bidirectional LSTM networks have a significant impact on modeling sequential data as they process the input data in both forward and backward directions. This allows the model to capture patterns and dependencies from past and future contexts within the sequence. As a result, bidirectional LSTMs can achieve superior performance in understanding the context, leading to improvements in tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and speech recognition, where context from both directions enhances understanding.
Taxonomy Level: Evaluate (5) | Question: Evaluate the challenges associated with training RNN-based architectures.  *Answer:* Training RNN-based architectures presents several challenges. One major challenge is the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it difficult for RNNs to learn long-term dependencies. This occurs because gradients of the loss function with respect to earlier layers diminish exponentially. Additionally, RNNs are prone to issues such as exploding gradients, where gradients become too large, and require gradient clipping techniques to manage. Computational inefficiency and longer training times are also downsides due to the sequential processing of data, which limits parallelization.

Taxonomy Level: Remember (1) | What is Transfer Learning in the context of Computer Vision? Can you briefly recall its main purpose without referring to any external resources? - Answer: "Transfer Learning for Computer Vision refers to a technique where a pre-trained model on one task is repurposed as the starting point for a different but related task. The idea is to leverage the learned features from the initial, large dataset to improve performance on a new, smaller dataset."
Taxonomy Level: Understand (2) | Describe in your own words how Transfer Learning can be beneficial when working with limited data in Indian image classification problems, for instance, classifying local flora or fauna. - Answer: "Transfer Learning is incredibly useful for tasks like identifying unique species of plants and animals prevalent in specific regions of India, where data might be sparse. By utilizing a pre-trained model trained on vast global image datasets (like ImageNet), we can harness the learned features that capture general visual patterns applicable to these local domains. This significantly reduces the need for extensive local dataset creation, saving time and resources while maintaining decent classification accuracy."
Taxonomy Level: Apply (3) | Suppose you're a part of an organization working on creating tools for identifying invasive plant species in India's dense forests where data collection is challenging due to the vastness of terrain. How would you apply Transfer Learning to this real-world scenario? - Answer: "To address the challenge, I'd first select a pre-trained model well-suited for image recognition tasks (like VGG or ResNet), then fine-tune it using our limited dataset specific to invasive plant species. This involves adjusting the last layers of the architecture to match the number of classes we want to recognize. Finally, I'd employ techniques like data augmentation on the spot to artificially increase our small dataset's size and robustness."
Taxonomy Level: Analyze (4) | Discuss in detail how Transfer Learning helps mitigate overfitting when applied to image classification problems specific to rural India where acquiring diverse, representative images can be difficult. - Answer: "Transfer Learning effectively combats overfitting in the context of rural Indian image classification due to several reasons. Firstly, pre-trained models like VGG or ResNet have learned rich features that generalize well across various visual scenarios thanks to their extensive exposure to diverse images from ImageNet or other large datasets. Secondly, these models are 'pretrained' on a vast collection of images; thus, they start with an inbuilt bias towards generic features rather than specific patterns seen only in one dataset, which reduces the risk of memorizing training data. Lastly, when fine-tuning, we maintain a lower learning rate to prevent drastic alterations in learned weights that could potentially lead to overfitting."
Taxonomy Level: Evaluate (5) | Evaluate Transfer Learning for Computer Vision by discussing both its advantages and potential drawbacks, especially considering Indian image datasets might have imbalanced class distributions due to the prevalence of certain species. - Answer: "Transfer Learning offers substantial advantages for Indian image classification tasks, given the scarcity of local data. It leverages powerful feature extractors from large external datasets, enabling effective learning with fewer labeled samples, and reduces overfitting through initialization weights learned in a broader context. However, potential limitations arise due to class imbalance common in biodiversity studies: - Positive Evaluation: The pre-trained models can still learn discriminative features effectively, thanks to their depth. They tend to generalize well as they capture wide ranges of visual elements, even if some classes are underrepresented in the initial training data. - Negative Evaluation: Despite its strengths, Transfer Learning could be less optimal for rare or minority classes since it might not get ample exposure during pre-training to learn their unique characteristics. This can lead to suboptimal performance on these classes, especially if the fine-tuning process does not adequately adjust model parameters with the limited available data."
Taxonomy Level: Create (6) | Propose a novel Transfer Learning approach tailored for Indian agricultural image analysis, considering the need to identify and monitor various plant diseases in real time using drones equipped with cameras. - Answer: "To tackle this complex problem, I‚Äôd design a three-phase Transfer Learning strategy leveraging both domain adaptation and active learning principles. Firstly, employ an InceptionV3 model as the base pre-trained architecture due to its robust feature extraction capabilities. Next, perform domain adaptation by adapting this model through a series of self-supervised techniques that align it with Indian agricultural image characteristics (e.g., contrast normalization). Following this, implement an active learning loop where initial uncertainty is identified among predicted classifications using an ensemble model like Xception or EfficientNet for improved accuracy. With these uncertain samples, collect data from drone-captured images of crops and label them manually by domain experts. These newly labeled instances will then be added to the training set, iteratively refining our model. To ensure real-time capabilities, a lightweight version like MobileNetV2 could be considered in later stages for efficient inference on embedded systems within drone processing units."
