      "\n",
      "Q2: Explain how the learning rate influences convergence in stochastic gradient descent.\n",

This aligns with the Indian engineering focus on understanding ‘how things work’.\\nExpected Answer: \\\"Backpropagation is used to adjust the weights of the convolutional filters during training.

The focus on ‘robustness’ is key – aligning with the engineering mindset of designing reliable systems.\\nExpected Answer: \\\"Max-pooling tends to highlight the most prominent features, making the network more robust to small variations in the input image.

Describe the steps you would take, including selecting an appropriate segmentation algorithm and justifying your choice based on the typical characteristics of the image data (consider factors like lighting, noise, and varying crop density).” Explanation: This question requires students to apply their knowledge to a specific, relevant scenario. Rationale: This is highly relevant to India, given the agricultural sector's importance. It forces students to consider the practical challenges of applying segmentation in a real-world scenario – factors like varying lighting conditions in Indian fields, potential noise from moving machinery, and the variability of crop density.\n",

This occurs because gradients of the loss function with respect to earlier layers diminish exponentially. Additionally, RNNs are prone to issues such as exploding gradients, where gradients become too large, and require gradient clipping techniques to manage.

      "Analyze the impact of using Bidirectional LSTM networks in the modeling of sequential data.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Answer:* Bidirectional LSTM networks have a significant impact on modeling sequential data as they process the input data in both forward and backward directions. This allows the model to capture patterns and dependencies from past and future contexts within the sequence. As a result, bidirectional LSTMs can achieve superior performance in understanding the context, leading to improvements in tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and speech recognition, where context from both directions enhances understanding.\n",

      "Question:\n",
      "Evaluate the challenges associated with training RNN-based architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Answer:* Training RNN-based architectures presents several challenges. One major challenge is the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it difficult for RNNs to learn long-term dependencies. This occurs because gradients of the loss function with respect to earlier layers diminish exponentially. Additionally, RNNs are prone to issues such as exploding gradients, where gradients become too large, and require gradient clipping techniques to manage. Computational inefficiency and longer training times are also downsides due to the sequential processing of data, which limits parallelization.\n",

      "* **Question:** “Compare and contrast the potential biases that could be introduced during the pretraining phase of a language model versus the biases that could emerge during the reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) stage. Specifically, discuss how cultural context and the representation of diverse user groups could exacerbate these biases. Consider the challenges of collecting high-quality human feedback from a population in India.” * **Explanation:** This question requires students to break down complex concepts and identify relationships. It’s about critical analysis. * **Indian Context Relevance:** Bias in AI is a huge global concern, and this question asks students to consider the specific challenges of bias in language models trained on data that might not fully represent the diversity of India’s population and culture.\n",

It's a starting point for understanding the algorithm. Relatability for Indian students: Imagine a factory manager trying to optimize a production process - SGD can be likened to iteratively adjusting parameters based on a small sample of data to improve output.\",\n",
      "\"Understand\": \"Can you explain the key ideas behind Stochastic Gradient Descent? Specifically, how does the 'stochastic' aspect contribute to its learning process?\\nRationale: This goes beyond simple recall. Students need to demonstrate they understand the core concepts – the mini-batch approach, the error signal, and how it’s used to update parameters. Relatability for Indian students: Think of it like a farmer adjusting irrigation based on a small patch of land to maximize crop yield – the “stochastic” element is like the unpredictable weather affecting the small sample.\",\n",

How would you apply Stochastic Gradient Descent to train a model to predict yield? Be specific about the mini-batch size you'd choose and why.\\nRationale: This requires the student to apply SGD to a practical scenario. It forces them to think about practical considerations like mini-batch size, which significantly impacts learning speed and stability. Relatability for Indian students: This is very relevant to the agricultural sector – a key industry in India.\",\n",

The data shows a significant class imbalance – far more operational data than failure data. How might this imbalance impact the performance of SGD, and what steps could you take to mitigate this issue?\\nRationale: This pushes students to analyze the impact of a common data challenge (class imbalance) on SGD. It requires them to think about the consequences and potential solutions. Relatability for Indian students: This relates to the challenges of predicting failures in machinery – a major concern in India’s manufacturing sector.\",\n",

Detail the data you would collect, the CNN architecture you would propose, and how you would evaluate its performance. Consider the challenges of collecting and labeling data in a rural Indian setting.” Explanation: This is a culminating task, requiring students to synthesize their knowledge and design a complete solution. Rationale for India: Agriculture is a cornerstone of the Indian economy. This application is highly relevant and challenging, demanding a holistic approach.\n",

      "Analyze the components and working of Attention Mechanism in Transformers. Specifically, how does the softmax function contribute to the weighting of different parts of the input sequence, and what are the implications of this weighting for the model’s performance?\n",
      "Justification: This question asks students to dissect the process. It requires them to not just describe what happens, but why it happens – particularly focusing on the role of the softmax function in producing the attention weights.
